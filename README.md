# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
### Purpose

  Help Pewlett-Hackard determine the number of employees that will be retiring per title and finding how many employees would be eligible for the mentorship program that will eventually lead them to replace the retirees. To help PH with their analysis and prepare for the "silver tsunami", this challenge is for us to create entity relationship diagrams (ERDs), import data into a database, create queries, and troubleshoot errors by applying our knowledge of DataFrames and data. 

## Results

- The highest number of employees that will be retiring are Senior Engineers and the lowest number of employees retiring (significantly) are managers.

- This company has majority of senior engineers of overall employment staff which means they will have to find more engineers to take their place once they retire. 
- According to the mentorship_elibility data, there are 417 employees eligibile for mentorship are for Senior Staff roles which is also the majority. 
- There are three roles in Engineering: Assistant Engineer, Engineer, and Senior Engineer. There are total of 748 employees eligible for engineer mentorship. 

## Summary

- As the "silver tsunami" approaches, there are 90,398 roles in total that will need to be filled to make an impact.

- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees? Yes there is! As there are 90,398 roles overall that will need to be filled and only 1550 employees that are eligible for mentorship to fill those roles. For senior position roles, roles that are below senior level can also be promoted to senior.
